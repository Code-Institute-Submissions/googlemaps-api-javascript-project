The brief for this assignment was to produce a static web application that calls
on the Google Maps API to allow users to search for their next holiday destination.

This project was to practice and test Javascript to provide some functionality
to a static web application. Using Google Maps API, I've been able to manipulate
Google Maps to produce markers and information windows based specific coordinates
of certain attractions, hotels, bars and restaurants in five different locations
in Europe.
The choices of holiday destinations for our users are London, Paris, Rome, Berlin
and Amsterdam for those holiday makers who don't want to waste time searching for 
the right holiday.

# UX
This application is useful for holiday makers searching for their next European
holiday with a choice of 5 destinations.

The destinations chosen would be suitable for families, couples or singletons
searching for a new experience. 
If the user wants a classic touristic and sightseeing filled holiday, the map provides
markers showing attractions around the city. 
Some user's perhaps may not want to spend a fortune in an expensive hotel so not 
all accomodation is luxury however all hotels shown are central enough to be 
close to the action. Lastly if the user is a big foodie or want to experience the
nightlife, then a variety of restaurants and bars are displayed to ensure their 
evenings are filled with entertainment.
